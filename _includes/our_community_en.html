						<p>In short, everyone interested in OpenStreetMap in Belgium is part of our community. First of all we have our mappers but we also have people volunteering in a range of activities or helping with building software, organizing mapathons or help with OpenStreetMap related events. Our goal is to make everyone feel welcome and if you are still reading this we probably already consider you part of our community.</p>

						<h4>OpenStreetMap Belgium, our mission!</h4>
						<p>So, if everyone is part of the community then what's OpenStreetMap Belgium all about? Our main mission is to facilitate mapping activities in Belgium and make sure everyone feels welcome. You can call us 'crazy' about mapping, perhaps a bit a more than the average community member. If you want to help to improve and grow the mapping community in Belgium, to make even more people crazy about mapping, OpenStreetMap Belgium is the right place for you!
